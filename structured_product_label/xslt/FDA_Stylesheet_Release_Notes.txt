How to take advantage of the Print View (xml to pdf converter):

Method A - run the program from command line
============================================

Step 1: download and install the Formatting Object Processor (FOP) from the Apache web site (http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/0.94/index.html).  Note: this version works with FOP version 0.94. 

Step 2: unzip the stylesheet into the same folder as the FOP.

Step 3: open a command prompt and cd to the directory where SPL and images resided.

Step 4: issue the following command:

   "%FOP_HOME%fop" -xml myspl.xml -xsl "%FOP_HOME%spl-fo.xsl" -foout myspl.fo

   where: a) FOP_HOME is the directory where you installed the FOP
          b) myspl.xml is the input SPL
          c) myspl.fo is an intermediate formatting object file

Step 5: issue the following command:

 "%FOP_HOME%fop" -r myspl.fo myspl.pdf
   where: a) myspl.fo is an intermediate formatting object file
          b) myspl.pdf is the converted PDF file



Method B - create a java program to automate the above steps
============================================================

Consult the FOP web site for APIs and documentation on how to do this.


Note: due to security measures, xml-verbatim.js (javascript) has been renamed to xml-verbatim.js_txt in the zip file.  After unzipping, please rename the file back to .js extension.
